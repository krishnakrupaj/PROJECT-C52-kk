    <h3>WHAT IS ORIGAMI?</h3>
    <p>Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture.
     In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, 
     regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper 
     into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami 
     practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. 
     Origami folders often use the Japanese word kirigami
      to refer to designs which use cuts.</p>

    <h3>HISTORY OF ORIGAMI</h3>
    <p>Paper was first invented in China around 105 A.D., and was brought to Japan by monks in the sixth century.
         Handmade paper was a luxury item only available to a few, and paper folding in ancient Japan was strictly 
         for ceremonial purposes, often religious in nature.</p>

       <p>By the Edo period (1603–1868), paper folding in Japan had become recreational as well as ceremonial,
        often featuring 
        multiple cuts and folds. It came to be regarded as a new form of art that was enabled by the advent of paper 
        both mass-produced and more affordable. Written instructions for paper folding first appeared in 1797,
        with Akisato Rito’s Sembazuru Orikata, or “thousand crane folding.” In 1845, Adachi Kazuyuki published a more
        comprehensive compilation of paper folding with Kayaragusa; by the late 1800s, the term for paper folding had
        morphed from orikata (“folded shapes”) to origami.</p>
        
        <p>Europe also has a tradition of paper folding that dates back to the twelfth century or before,
        when the Moors brought a tradition of mathematically based folding to Spain. The Spanish further
        developed paper folding into an artistic practice called papiroflexia or pajarita. By the 1800s, 
        kindergarten-aged
        children in Europe and Japan were learning paper folding.</p>
